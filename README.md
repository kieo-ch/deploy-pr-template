# Deploy PR Template

`deploy.zsh` is a script that takes a list of repos in a `repos.yaml` and deploys a PR template in `template.md`. Its final output is a list of PR URLs.

This repo has a preset `repos.yaml` & `template.md` which are used by Team ThunderCats. If another team wants to use this, make sure you change these where appropriate.
